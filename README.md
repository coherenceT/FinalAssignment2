This essay will elaborate on how I came about the completion of this assignment. So the things things were really worrying all this talk about linking activities adding a new activity into the main activity and all that was just constant brain heat and brought great stress. But with the help of my lecturer, he gave me an idea he hinted us on something about loops being used in the assignment then I went to go and try and do some research only to be more confused so now I’m thinking how I am going to add buttons to separate activities while linking them at the same time it made no sense to me. Time goes by I eventually come across a friend who had already completed the assignment and handed it in tried to ask for help he did not budge at all so I then moved on to go and try add some more pet logic ideas and what to implement into my app and how to add percent bars that monitor the pets health and happiness and cleanliness by this time oi had no idea on what pet I was going to be using until I eventually decided on a red dragon. Then the app as made for kids which kids like dragons’ little boys do even my little brother likes my app, so I have nothing to worry about now I’m happy that I finally got the pet. So a few weeks pass I eventually come across an idea I managed to ad percentage bars and I added the text views for them then I also added the code for the percentage bars to work but had no idea on linking the buttons to the image views so I then later got some insight and was able to come about actually getting the buttons to link up to the images what was left now was linking the activities amongst each other to work in sync to make the welcome page disappear and the user Interface by itself after that. The thing is that I helped many groups and helping them they have my code but the activates look different in my code after you press start you need to press any of the buttons then my app with its progress bars will be able to work they go to the defaults that I set them all the buttons work feed clean and play and there is logic for the pet dying as well
